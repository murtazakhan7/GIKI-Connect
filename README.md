Developed a Django platform connecting GIKI students and alumni through Student, Alumni, and Admin interfaces. Implemented backend
models, forms, and views with Django REST Framework to expose JSON APIs alongside server-rendered pages for connection/mentorship
requests, application review, and moderation. Built a responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS with Django's built-in SQLite database.
